## Helps delete emails from gmail.

To begin with, use the search form on Gmail to search for patterns. Use the same search string to update the variable "qstring =" in the main.py script and run it. <p>

You must also enable the API for Gmail to get this going. Once you enable the Gmail API and create the credentials. Please download it onto the local directory.
